= ontopia-topicmaps - Query topic maps with Ontopia

== VERSION

This documentation refers to ontopia-topicmaps version 0.0.2


== DESCRIPTION

Query topic maps with Ontopia[http://ontopia.net/]. A working
installation[http://ontopia.net/doc/current/install.html] of Ontopia needs to
be present (point to it through the +OTM_BASE+ environment variable in case it
cannot be found automatically). Note, though, that it's not required to run the
Ontopia application server, only the JAR files are needed.


== SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Ontopia::Topicmaps requires JRuby[http://jruby.org]. It has been tested with
jruby 1.7.4 (1.9.3p392) on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.6.0_27-b27 [linux-amd64].
